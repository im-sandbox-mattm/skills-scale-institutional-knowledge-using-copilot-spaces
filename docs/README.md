# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation! This collection of guides and resources is designed to help you understand our project management processes, whether you're a new team member getting onboarded or an experienced colleague looking to reference specific decision-making processes.

## How to Use These Docs

- **New Team Members**: Start with the [Project Management Overview](#documentation) to understand our core principles and approach, then explore the [Roles & Personas](#documentation) to understand your responsibilities.
- **Project Managers**: Reference the step-by-step guides for [Project Initiation](#documentation), [Planning](#documentation), [Execution & Tracking](#documentation), and [Release & Deployment](#documentation) as you manage your projects.
- **All Team Members**: Use these documents as a single source of truth for processes, communication protocols, and quality standards.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes ensure consistent, collaborative, and reliable outcomes. Projects start with initiation—one-pager, stakeholder alignment, and resource scoping—before moving into comprehensive planning with a prioritized backlog, milestones, dependency mapping, and clear acceptance criteria. Well-defined roles (Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, QA, Stakeholder) support ownership and collaboration, with dedicated communication rhythms (standups, weekly syncs, demos, stakeholder updates, escalation protocols).

Execution centers on project board workflows and rigorous review/testing, supported by CI pipelines and reporting dashboards. Risks are tracked and escalated via a clear path. Releases follow standardized requirements, with rollback plans and notifications. Continuous improvement is embedded through retrospectives and action-tracking.

These strategies yield repeatable, high-quality delivery with transparency, enabling rapid onboarding and reducing dependency risks.
